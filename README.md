Age (vs) Spending Score
-------------------------
The approach followed to find customer segmentation is the K-means clustering algorithm to help the malls/complexes target the type of audience. 
K-means clustering algorithm is a type of unsupervised learning where 'K' denotes the number of clusters. The optimal 'K' value is found using the Elbow method.
-------------------------
Here, We have taken Age and Spending Score as factors to find the right target audience and help the mall/complex to focus on the particular age group having more
spending score.
